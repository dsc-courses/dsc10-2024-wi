**Tip: When working on assignments, use Ctrl+F on this page to search for a keyword and quickly find the relevant lecture. Click the ✏️ emoji to open a static version of the lecture for reference, which is much faster than loading it on DataHub. Also, make sure to use the [reference sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ky0Np67HS2O4LO913P-ing97SJG0j27n/view?usp=sharing)!**
