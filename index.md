**Tip: When working on assignments, use Ctrl+F on this page to search for a keyword and quickly find the relevant lecture. Click the ‚úèÔ∏è emoji to open a static version of the lecture for reference, which is much faster than loading it on DataHub. Also, make sure to use the [reference sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ky0Np67HS2O4LO913P-ing97SJG0j27n/view?usp=sharing)!**

**Announcement: Janine is out of town on Friday 3/8 and there will be no live lecture that day. Instead, you will watch a recording of the lecture asynchronously. This message will be updated when that recording is available.**
